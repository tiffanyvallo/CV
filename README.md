I am an aspiring Junior Developer. After my whole working life in the NHS, I decided to switch career paths and pursue a career that I would find more fulfilling and satisfying. The tech industry is continuously changing, I find that everyday is a new and exciting challenge that I am eager to take on. 

## Projects

[Shuttr](https://github.com/tiffanyvallo/cyber_playground)
<br />
Have you ever wanted to take amazing photos but don’t know where to go to take them? We have the solution for you.
We wanted to build an innovative app for the creatives who love to take aesthetic photos but don’t know where the prime locations are. 
Shutter allows users to build a community where they can discover pins around London, explore hashtags you are interested in, run location searches, share your own photos and view other pins on a map. 

[MakersBnb](https://github.com/tiffanyvallo/in_the_airbnb_tonight)
<br />
Created a web application clone of AirBnb that allows users to list spaces they have available and to hire spaces for the night.  

[Chitter](https://github.com/tiffanyvallo/chitter-challenge)
<br />
Built a clone of Twitter that allows users to sign up, login, log out and create and view peeps.

[Notes App](https://github.com/tiffanyvallo/thermostat)
<br />
Build a single-page web application using pure Javascript that allows users to create notes and see each note individually. Created our own testing framework to allow us to TDD this process and used an external API to integrate the use of emojis.

[Thermostat](https://github.com/tiffanyvallo/thermostat)
<br />
Create a web application that uses a dynamic visual interface using the browser's DOM functions, and use Javascript to fetch data from an API and display the information on the webpage.

## Technical Knowledge
Throughout my time at Makers, I was able to learn new languages and use a number of technologies which I have applied to a number of my projects.

## Skills

#### Problem Solving

- Working in the NHS, you are faced with a wide range of queries on a daily basis. I have been faced with queries from finding out appointment dates, to figuring out staff's pay, and everytime I have been able to investigate and solve all these issues. Being also helped with finding different solutions on how you can tackle the problem in front of you.

#### Teamwork

- All my previous job roles entailed me working within a team. From this I have been able to learn that relying on each other to complete tasks is crucial. Whether it is covering a colleagues workload when they are on leave, or informing one another which stage you have reached in terms of a patient's records. Organisation and communication also help in ensuring everyone on the team is able to do their work and allow for a smooth workflow. I found that I really excelled and enjoyed contributing to group projects during the Makers course.

#### Attention to detail

- I have developed good attention to detail. During several of my roles in the NHS I noticed how there was a lack of systems put in place to ensure efficient running of services. I create a number of systems that allow my colleagues and myself to easily log and search the pipeline of patient's referrals or staff's recruitment process. These tasks were the starting point of my interest in the tech industry. This really helped during project planning stages and code debugging.

#### Adaptable

- Throughout Makers I had to learn new languages and testing frameworks in an efficient manner all while building applications. This was challenging but allowed me to rise to the occasion and get a feel for how as a developer, you need to be comfortable with change and learning to adapt to whatever situation is given to you. With new pairing programming sessions daily, different teams and new challenges weekly, I was able to push myself to learn to adapt and help create good team dynamics to allow us to create the best application we could produce.  

## Experience

**St Georges Universitys NHS Trust** (October 2014 to March 2021)  
_A breadth of experience in a number of administrative roles_

- I have a background in psychology with experience in data management, service operations and recruitment. After working as a successful data manager for the NHS in demanding and time pressured roles, I have been able to gain a range of analytical and decisive skills that will enable my expansion and growth into new endeavours. Working hard with efficiency, along with having a friendly and approachable persona are traits I believe are important to my work ethic; enabling me to carry out and delegate tasks, meet deadlines all while building positive relationships with my colleagues.

## Interests

I have recently taken up painting and find it relaxing being able to fill a blank canvas with the images you see in your head. I also dwell in a bit of photography, being able to witness and capture the beauty in the world is so fascinating. Other than that, dramas, animes and food pretty much take up the rest of my life.
